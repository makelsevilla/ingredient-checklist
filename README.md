# Ingredient Checklist
A sample coding interview exam I saw online for a company based in the Philippines.
I'll be using Laravel (Back-End) and React with InertiaJS (Front-End).

# BASIC OPERATION
- The user wants a way to create a list for each of their recipes.
- A recipe contains a list of ingredients.
- When the user wants to cook a dish, create a blank copy of a recipe's ingredient checklist.
- The user should be able to check off the ingredients that they have.
- The user will want to be able to close their browser window and come back later. 
The system should remember their ingredient lists and their recipes.
  - Use Ajax to send informatino to the server when an ingredient is checked.
  - Use a database to save information.
- The system should support multiple users
  - Each user should have their own login and their own list of recipes.
  - Users should not be able to see each other's information.
- Please use:
  - Web API for CRUD operations.
  - Controllers to serve your Views.
